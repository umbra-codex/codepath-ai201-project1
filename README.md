# The Unofficial Guide

Name: Sean Humphreys
Corpus: `advice_threads`

# Stretch Features

I'm adding two stretch features: metadata filtering, so you can narrow a search
to specific threads by source, and conversation memory, so a follow-up question
in the same session can build on the last one.

---

# Unit 1

## What This Does

This system answers questions from `advice_threads`, a corpus of 23 student
forum threads about college life. Ask it how much RAM a CS laptop needs or
whether it's too late to change majors, and it answers from what students
wrote, naming the thread it used. When the threads don't cover a question, it
says so instead of guessing.

## Chunking Strategy

**Chunk Size:** 800
**Overlap:** 0

The `advice_threads` corpus is 23 forum threads, 320 to 796 characters
each: a question, then two to five replies. In Milestone 1, I noticed the
replies depend on each other. In the bike thread, reply 3 opens with "Both
true," which means nothing without replies 1 and 2.

So each thread stays whole. `CHUNK_SIZE=800` sits just above the longest
thread (796), which gives 23 chunks for 23 documents.

I use no `CHUNK_OVERLAP` because no thread gets cut. The starter's `800/120`
setting stepped forward 680 characters at a time, so three threads over
`680` got a second chunk holding only their tails, one of them two characters
long.

## Sample Chunks

<!-- Five chunks, pasted as text. Label each one and name the file it came from
     AND the function that produced it — the grader checks your code against
     what you claim here.

     `python app.py chunks -n 5` prints all three for you. Copy them straight
     across.

**Chunk 1** — source: thread_bike_commute.txt#0 `— produced by: chunker.py::split_documents`

```
THREAD: Is a bike worth it for a 20 minute walk commute?

--- reply 1 (14 votes) ---
Yeah. Cuts an 18 minute walk to about 6. The thing nobody mentions is storage — covered bike parking exists at three buildings and is full by 9am at all three.

--- reply 2 (9 votes) ---
Counterpoint, I sold mine. Between November and March the paths are either icy or salted and salt destroys a drivetrain in one season.

--- reply 3 (22 votes) ---
Both true. I keep a cheap bike for September to November and walk the rest of the year. Total cost was about $120 for the bike and I don't care what happens to it.

--- reply 4 (5 votes) ---
If you do get one, the campus does free registration and it's the only reason I got mine back after it was taken.

THREAD: Anything specific for first-generation students?

--- reply 1 (33 votes) ---
The advising office has a specific programme and it is genuinely good, but it is opt-in and badly publicised. Ask for it by name.

--- reply 2 (41 votes) ---
The thing I'd say: the unwritten rules are the hard part, not the coursework. Ask about the unwritten rules explicitly. People are happy to explain them and nobody volunteers them.

--- reply 3 (16 votes) ---
Emergency fund for textbooks and travel exists and is not means-tested beyond a short form.

THREAD: How much laptop do I actually need for CS courses?

--- reply 1 (31 votes) ---
Less than the recommended spec page says. 16GB of RAM is the one number worth paying for; everything else you'll never notice.

--- reply 2 (18 votes) ---
Adding: the lab machines exist and are better than anything you'll buy. For the heavy assignments people just use those.

--- reply 3 (12 votes) ---
I did two years on an 8GB machine and it was fine until the last project, chunker.py::split_documentsat which point it very much wasn't. 16 is the answer.

**Chunk 4** — source: thread_office_hours_etiquette.txt#0 `— produced by: chunker.py::split_documents`

```
THREAD: Is it weird to go to office hours with no specific question?

--- reply 1 (44 votes) ---
No, and this is the single most common thing first years get wrong. 'I'm following the lectures but I don't feel like I understand the shape of it' is a completely normal thing to say.

--- reply 2 (29 votes) ---
They're usually empty. You are doing the instructor a favour by turning up.

--- reply 3 (18 votes) ---
If it helps, treat it as a standing appointment. Go every week for a month and it stops feeling like a thing.

**Chunk 5** — source: thread_professor_email.txt#0 `— produced by: chunker.py::split_documents`

```
THREAD: Do professors actually answer email?

--- reply 1 (21 votes) ---
Varies enormously. General rule I've found: if the syllabus states a response window, it's honoured. If it doesn't, assume 48 hours and don't panic before then.

--- reply 2 (33 votes) ---
Office hours are dramatically more effective than email for anything that takes more than two sentences to answer. They're also usually empty.

--- reply 3 (15 votes) ---
Empty office hours is the biggest unused resource here and I say that having wasted a year not going.

For each one, ask: could someone answer a question using only this,
without reading what came before or after?

## Sample Answer

<!-- One complete question and answer, pasted as text, with the source line
     visible. Milestone 4. -->

**Question:** What is the CPU, and how much memory is within the laptop?

**Answer:** Based on the provided documents, there is no mention of the laptop's CPU. However, regarding memory, the documents suggest having 16GB of RAM (thread_laptop_specs.txt).

## How I Used AI

<!-- Two specific moments. For each: what you asked for, what came back, and
     what you changed about it.

     "I asked Claude to write the chunking function from my notes. It ignored
     the overlap, so I added that myself" is the level of detail we're after.
     "I used AI to help me code" is not.

     Milestone 5. -->

**1.** I asked Claude to give a summary of the documents in advice_threads so I
can think of questions for Milestone 2.

**2.** I asked Claude for a guide to create the split_documents function and had
it verify the logic and output when completed.

# Unit 2

<!-- These sections get ADDED to what's already above. Don't delete or rewrite
     unit 1 — the point is that someone can see what you said before you knew
     how it went. -->

## Run Log — Before

<!-- Your five criteria, three runs each. `python run_eval.py --label before`
     runs the questions, puts the OUT_OF_SCOPE ones through the gate, and
     writes it all into results/ for you. Targets come from criteria.md; the
     verdict column is your call.

     Criterion 3 is measured in one deterministic pass rather than three, so
     the same number goes in all three run columns. That's correct, not lazy.

     Milestone 1. -->

| Criterion                              | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
| -------------------------------------- | ------ | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------- |
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 | 3/5   | 3/5   | 3/5   | MISSED  |
| 2. Every answer names a source         | 5 of 5 | 5/5   | 5/5   | 5/5   | MET     |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions  | 4 of 5 | 5/5   | 5/5   | 5/5   | MET     |
| 4. One topic per chunk                 | 4 of 5 | 5/5   | 5/5   | 5/5   | MET     |
| 5. No hallucinated answers             | 4 of 5 | 2/2   | 2/2   | 2/2   | MET     |

Scored from `results/run_2026-09-30_1553_before.md` by `scorer.py::criterion_table`.

Criteria 3 and 4 are each measured in one deterministic pass, so the same
number goes in all three run columns.

Criterion 1 can't reach its target with this question set. Two of my five
questions (transfer-credit deadline, late-work deadline) ask for something the
corpus doesn't hold, so the most it can score is 3/5. It stays MISSED against
the 4-of-5 target I set in unit 1, and I diagnose it under Diagnoses.

Criterion 5 only applies when the retrieved chunks don't contain the answer,
which is those same two questions. Each run therefore has 2 tries, not 5, and
a cell of 2/2 can't be measured against "4 of 5" as the target is written.
Pooled across the three runs it is 6 of 6 tries, which is above a four-in-five
rate, so I marked it MET. Testing the target as written needs at least five
tries where the chunks lack the answer.

The question table in the results file shows `pass` on all 15 runs, which
measures something different. `scorer.py::judge` passes a run when it meets
criterion 1 or criterion 5, plus criterion 2. The table above counts each
criterion on its own, which is why criterion 1 reads 3/5.

<!-- Underneath, paste the REAL output for each criterion from one of your
     runs — the actual text your system produced, not a description of it.
     Name the file and function that produced it. -->

### Real output

Everything below is run 1 from `results/run_2026-09-30_1553_before.md`, except
the chunk text for criteria 1 and 4. The results file keeps sources but not
chunk text, so those two were printed again with `app.py`. Retrieval is
deterministic and the distances match the log.

**Criterion 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer**

Question: "Is it too late to change majors as a third- or fourth-year student?"
Expected phrase: `extra semester`.

Retrieval, produced by `store.py::search` (printed by `python app.py retrieve`).
The `Gate:` line comes from `gate.py::check`:

THREAD: How hard is it to change major in second year?

--- reply 1 (22 votes) ---
Administratively trivial — it's a form. The real question is whether the credits you've taken map onto the new requirements.

--- reply 2 (27 votes) ---
Depends enormously on the direction. Moving within the sciences is usually fine. Moving into a science from outside in your third year means an extra semester more often than not.

--- reply 3 (19 votes) ---
Talk to the department adviser for the major you want, not your current one. They know the exceptions.
```

**Criterion 2. Every answer names a source**

Same question, run 1. The answer text is produced by
`generate.py::answer_from_chunks`, called from `run_eval.py::run_once`, and
written to the results file by `run_eval.py::main`.

- Best distance: 0.4019 (passed the gate)
- Sources retrieved: thread_changing_major.txt, thread_first_year_regret.txt, thread_pass_fail.txt

```
Based on the provided documents, moving into a science from outside in your third year often means an extra semester, but the documents do not cover whether it is too late to change majors as a fourth-year student (*thread_changing_major.txt*).
```

**Criterion 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions**

Produced by `run_eval.py::check_out_of_scope`, cutoff 0.7. Refused 5 of 5.

| Out-of-scope question | Best distance | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| What is the capital of Mongolia? | 0.948 | refused |
| How do I change the oil in a diesel engine? | 0.930 | refused |
| Who won the 1994 World Cup? | 0.952 | refused |
| What is the recommended dosage of ibuprofen for a headache? | 0.828 | refused |
| How do I write a for loop in Rust? | 0.871 | refused |

**Criterion 4. One topic per chunk**

The five sampled chunks, produced by `chunker.py::split_documents` (printed by
`python app.py chunks`). Each has one source file and one `THREAD:` header.

```
23 chunks total. Showing 5, spread across the corpus.

**Criterion 5. No hallucinated answers**

Question: "What is the deadline for assignments before they're considered late?"
The corpus has no late cutoff, so the right answer is to say so. Run 1. The
answer text is produced by `generate.py::answer_from_chunks`, called from
`run_eval.py::run_once`, and written to the results file by `run_eval.py::main`.

- Best distance: 0.4132 (passed the gate)
- Sources retrieved: thread_first_year_regret.txt, thread_group_project.txt, thread_late_work.txt

```
Based on the provided documents, there is no mention of a specific deadline for assignments before they're considered late, though they do mention deadlines regarding asking for extensions (thread_late_work.txt). Therefore, I do not have enough information to answer this question.
```

## Verdicts

<!-- MET or MISSED for each of the five, against the target you wrote last
     unit — not a new one. Plus a sentence on how you decided. That sentence
     matters most where it was close.

     If your target said 4 of 5 and your runs came out 4, 3, 4, that's a MISS.
     The target has to hold, not show up occasionally.

     Milestone 2. -->

| #   | Criterion | Verdict | How I decided |
| --- | --------- | ------- | ------------- |
| 1   |           |         |               |
| 2   |           |         |               |
| 3   |           |         |               |
| 4   |           |         |               |
| 5   |           |         |               |

## Diagnoses

<!-- For each miss: which stage caused it, and how. The stage alone isn't
     enough — you need the mechanism.

     Not a diagnosis: "Question 3 didn't work."
     A diagnosis:     "Question 3 asks about laundry costs. The answer is in
                       one sentence that got split across two chunks, so
                       neither chunk on its own contains it."

     The five stages: loading → chunking → embedding → retrieval → generation.

     Look for a pattern. If three misses all ask about numbers, that's one
     problem, not three.

     Missed nothing? Say so, then say honestly whether your targets were set
     low, and which one you'd tighten and to what.

     Milestone 3. -->

## The Improvement

**Why I picked it:**

<!-- Connect it to a specific diagnosis above in one sentence. If you can't,
     you picked a fix because it sounded impressive. -->

### Run Log — After

<!-- Same format, same five criteria, three runs each.
     `python run_eval.py --label after` -->

| Criterion                              | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
| -------------------------------------- | ------ | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------- |
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |       |       |       |         |
| 2. Every answer names a source         | 5 of 5 |       |       |       |         |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions  | 4 of 5 |       |       |       |         |
| 4.                                     |        |       |       |       |         |
| 5.                                     |        |       |       |       |         |

**Did it help?**

<!-- Say plainly whether it did, and how you know. If it made things worse,
     say that — a change that backfired, honestly reported, earns full credit
     and is more interesting than one that worked. What matters is that you can
     tell.

     Milestone 4. -->

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each criterion still missed after your fix: what you'd do about it,
     and why you stopped where you did.

     "I ran out of time" is fine if it's true. Pretending nothing is left is
     not.

     Milestone 5. -->

## What I'd Do Differently

<!-- Knowing what you know now — which of your five criteria would you write
     differently, and why?

     Milestone 5. -->
